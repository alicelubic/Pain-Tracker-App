# Pain Tracker app for Android

The user can easily report their experience and view trends to identify triggers, without being overwhelmed by medical detail. 

There are two main functions: 1. Daily assessments of pain level, sleep quality, food consumption, and stress level, and 2. keep track of which remedies were used that day to treat those symptoms. 

By looking at his/her daily summary, the user can better understand his/her own experience, and more accurately report to medical professionals. 

Its intuitive UI features Material Design principles, and all data is stored in a SQLite database.
